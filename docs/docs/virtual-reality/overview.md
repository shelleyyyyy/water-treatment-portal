# Virtual Reality

Virtual reality plays an important role in our water treatment test bed project by allowing users to interact with a digital representation of the physical water treatment facility. Our VR implementation uses the Unity game engine along with the SteamVR plugin for interactions. Users can navigate around the virtual environment using VR controllers and observe the operations of the treatment plant in a realistic and immersive manner. Additionally, we have integrated MQTT communication with the VR environment, so that any changes made to the physical or digital twin representation of the water treatment facility will be reflected in the VR environment in real-time. This allows users to see the effects of their actions on the treatment plant and provides a powerful tool for training and testing purposes.
