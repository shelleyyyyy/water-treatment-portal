# Overview

Our water treatment test bed project is a comprehensive solution that consists of various components including physical hardware representation, virtual reality, software management site, automation scripts, and a digital twin. 

## Physical Hardware Representation

The physical hardware representation is a physical implementation of a water treatment plant that allows us to simulate and test various cyber threats and attacks on a real-world system.

## Virtual Reality

The virtual reality component enables us to create a simulated environment that can be used to train personnel on how to respond to cyber threats and attacks. It provides a safe and controlled environment where individuals can practice responding to attacks without risking real-world consequences.

## Software Management Site

The software management site is a central location where we manage the various components of the test bed. This includes monitoring and controlling the physical hardware representation, the virtual reality component, and the automation scripts.

## Automation Scripts

The automation scripts enable us to run the physical and virtual water treatment facilities automatically. This allows us to test different scenarios and responses without the need for manual intervention.

## Digital Twin

The digital twin is a simulation of the water treatment plant that allows us to simulate and test different scenarios and responses without risking damage to the physical system. It is a key component of our overall cyber red team operations, allowing us to test and improve our ability to detect and respond to cyber threats and attacks.
